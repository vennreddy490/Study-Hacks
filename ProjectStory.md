## Inspiration
We were inspired to build Study-Hacks after struggling to adjust to our own schedules for our second semester of college. It's easy for college students to get overwhelmed when they have to balance exams, jobs, clubs, and campus involvement, leading many students to feel stressed, sleep-deprived, and burnt out. Many students, ourselves included, develop routines over the course of the semester - adapting and forming habits that work through trial and error. It's difficult to rework those routines every semester as class periods, meal times, and sleep patterns change  - leading us to make a tool to help students better adjust to their classes and improve their time-management skills.

## What it does
Study-Hacks allows students to create schedules that work for them, using techniques meant to help students learn effectively and efficiently. It generates blocks of time around classes, meal-times, and other activities where students should study while blocking off time for proper sleep. These "study blocks" utilize the Pomodoro technique: studying for 25 minutes, followed a 5 minute break, then repeating, in order to help students get the most out of their study time. 

## How we built it
- JavaFX: frontEnd
- Java: backEnd
- Git: to do collaboration
- Utiltized a lot of JAVAFX API documentation

## Challenges we ran into
- getting and configuring javafx to work properly on vscode
- managing scene graphs for dozens of components
- making the program dynamic - adding and removing events and activites required us to greatly restructure our scene graph
- Creating the formula to generate study blocks without leading to time-conflicts, and storing them properly
- Managing ambition within the scope of time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- managed to better learn and use javaFX with limited starting knowledge
- actually signed up for a Hackathon 
- working collaboratively and learning github

## What we learned
- A lot more about JavaFX
- using git to code collaboratively
- Study effectively (we researched best ways to study)
- challenges of working in a team

## What's next for Study-Hacks
- error handling and managing edge cases
- improving the GUI to look nicer
- Potentially moving it to a website so people from anywhere can use it.
