## Inspiration
We were inspired to build Study-Hacks after struggling to adjust to our own schedules for our second semester of college. It's easy for college students to get overwhelmed when they have to balance exams, jobs, clubs, and campus involvement, leading many students feel stressed, sleep-deprived, and burnt out. Many students, ourselves included, develop routines over the course of the semester - adapting and forming habits that work through trial and error. It's difficult to rework those routines every semester as class periods, meal times, and sleep patterns change - leading us to make a tool to help students better adjust to their classes and improve their time-management skills.

## What it does
Study-Hacks allows students to create schedules that work for them, using techniques meant to help students learn effectively and efficiently. It generates blocks of time around classes, meal-times, and other activities where students should study while blocking off time for proper sleep. These "study blocks" utilize the Pomodoro technique: studying for 25 minutes, followed a 5 minute break, then repeating, in order to help students get the most out of their study time.
