*Note: In order to compile and run Study-Hacks, you will require JavaFX libraries on your computer. Our plans for the future involve porting Study-Hacks to a website in order to make it accessible and usable by anyone. 

# Our methodology #
We decided to break our blocks into Pomodoro's because it's a relatively well-known study technique and useful for helping students who are prone to getting distracted. While not the end-all-be-all of effective studying, we belive using the Pomodoro technique is essential for *setting* strong study habits -- the main goal of our application in the long-term. Further explanations and uses of the technique are available below.
